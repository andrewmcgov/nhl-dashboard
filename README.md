# NHL Dashboard

Simple dashboard of NHL information for the purpose of learning some basic React.

## NHL API Documentation
The NHL API is not documented publicly, but some very helpful people have self documented their findings. Checkout their work [here](https://github.com/dword4/nhlapi) and [here](https://github.com/erunion/sport-api-specifications/tree/master/nhl);

## Setup
If you want to test this out on your own, setup is fairly simple. 

Clone this repo:
`git clone git@github.com:andrewmcgov/nhl-dashboard.git`

In the dashboard folder, install dependencies:
`npm instal`

Start the React serverL
`npm start`

This project is just for the purpose of learning React. Thanks to the NHL for keeping their API open so we have fun/interesting data to work with. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
